# Notes about automated testing
- I wasn't able to get Selenium Manager working on my machine so I used Chromedriver instead
- To install, find the chromedriver binary for your machine [here](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/#stable) and put it on your path with the correct file permissions (same as Selenium Manager)
